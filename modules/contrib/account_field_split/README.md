# Account field split

Currently the draggable field "User name and password" mashes together:

- Username
- Current password
- E-mail address
- Change Password
- Roles
- Status
- Notify user about new account (when admin create new account)

Account Field Split aims to fix that problem for site builders who want to
manage those fields separately.

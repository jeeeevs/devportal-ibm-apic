INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a Drupal 9 module that adds a password strength plugin to the Password
Policy module. Implemented from https://github.com/bjeavons/zxcvbn-php

The purpose of this module is to provide a score for the strength of a password,
0 being very weak, 4 being very strong. This score is based on the concept of
"matchers". A matcher is an algorithm that evaluates a specific characteristic
of a password. More details can be found at
https://github.com/bjeavons/zxcvbn-php.

The great part of this tool is that you can create a constraint for a password
based on this scoring system. This score abstracts all of the complex logic and
password strength evaluation for a very simple and easy-to-use way to evaluate
the strength of a password. This is in contrast to stricter regulations which
need explicitly configured policies for passwords. This is a generic approach
which promotes usability and still advocates for strong passwords.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. Visit
   https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules
   for further information.


ARCHITECTURE
------------

  * Password strength is based on the Zxcvbn library, is pulled in via Composer
    Manager, and loads the library from https://github.com/bjeavons/zxcvbn-php
  * The module ships with a plugin system around matchers to allow for swappable
    matching algorithms to influence the score for customized needs.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

  * Create or update a password policy (admin/config/security/password-policy).
  * On the second step under "Add Constraint", select "Password Strength" and
    click "Configure Constraint Settings".
  * Select the minimum score for your policy (0 is very weak, 4 is very strong)
    and click "Save".
  * Finish the steps to save the policy.
  * Go to Password Policy Zxcvbn's configuration page
    (admin/config/security/password_strength/settings).
  * Turn on the Password Policy configuration.
